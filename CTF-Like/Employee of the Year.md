**Platform:** Blue Team Labs Online (BTLO)

**Scenario:** John received the 'Best Employee of the Year' award for his hard work at FakeCompany Ltd. Unfortunately, today John deleted some important files (typical John!). Itâ€™s your job to recover the deleted files and capture all the flags contained within!

**Category:** CTF-Like

**Type:** Challenge

**Difficulty:** Easy

**File:** `recoverfiles.dd`

**Tools:** `Photorec` `Exiftool` `CyberChef` `TestDisk`

> [PhotoRec](https://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/PhotoRec) is file data recovery software designed to recover lost files including video, documents and archives from hard disks, CD-ROMs, and lost pictures from     digital camera memory.
>
> [ExifTool](https://exiftool.org/) is a platform-independent Perl library plus a command-line application for reading, writing and editing meta information in a wide variety of files.
>
> [CyberChef](https://cyberchef.org/) is a simple, intuitive web app for analysing and decoding data without having to deal with complex tools or programming languages.
>
> [TestDisk](https://www.cgsecurity.org/testdisk_doc/) can be used to recover lost partitions, fix boot sectors, and recover files from damaged or deleted file systems. 

**Note:** For this walkthrough, I have spun up a Kali Linux virtual machine to utilize its tools. If you haven't set it up yet, I highly suggest following this [pentest lab](https://github.com/mmhgwyjs/pentest-lab) guide for your setup.

## **Preparations**

To answer the questions, we'll use Kali Linux. If you haven't set it up yet, check out the instructions [here](https://github.com/mmhgwyjs/pentest-lab/blob/main/README.md).

- Since the file provided is a disk image with a `.dd` extension, we'll use `photorec` to analyze it.

  > `photorec filename`
  
- It should create a directory.

## **Questions and Answers**

***1. What is the text written on the recovered gif image?***

- Since there's only one `GIF` among the extracted files, we can simply use the command `display filename` to view it.

- Microsoft Office documents can be considered as ZIP files that we can extract.

- We can view the XML files using the `cat` command, but they are not very user-friendly to read.

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f95eca8c-65ce-47fe-bada-97118fc52e69)

 - Let's use the command `xmllint` to view it better.

   > I used the `tail` command to view the last lines for a better representation, but I ended up skimming through the entire XML file to find what we are looking for.

- We'll use `CyberChef` to decode the base64 string `RkxBRzI6QVNPTElEREVGRU5ERVI=`.

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9ef7735f-5e9a-40fe-979a-c58db2176526)

- We can also decode it in `Kali` using the command `echo "string" | base64 -d`

  > FLAG3%3A%40BLU3T3AM%240LDI3R

- It appears to be encoded, so let's decode it using `CyberChef`.

  > Use `URL Decode` as the recipe.

  **Answer: `FLAG3:@BLU3T3AM$0LDI3R`**

***5. What is the filesystem of the provided disk image?***

- Let's use the tool called `testdisk`. Although there are multiple tools available to obtain the answer, such as `parted` and `fdisk`, we will use `testdisk` for this.

  **Answer: `ext4`**

***6. What is the original filename of the recovered mp4 file?***

- We can use the `strings` command to examine the raw `dd` file.
