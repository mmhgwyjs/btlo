**Platform:** Blue Team Labs Online (BTLO)

**Scenario:** A suspicious PowerShell script was found on one of our endpoints. Can you work out what it does?

**Category:** Reverse Engineering

**Type:** Challenge

**Difficulty:** Easy

**File:** `HDWallpaperEngine.txt`

**Tools:** `Text Editor (Notepad++)` `PowerShell`

**Note:** For this walkthrough, I have created an isolated virtual machine to analyze the provided file. If you have not set it up yet, I highly suggest following this [malware analysis lab](https://github.com/mmhgwyjs/malware-analysis-lab/blob/main/README.md) guide for your setup.
